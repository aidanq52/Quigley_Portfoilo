                <br/>
                <p class="bio">My name is <b>Aidan Quigley</b>. I am a molecular biologist intent on expanding my skillset. At the start of February 2020 I sustained a traumatic knee injury which forced me to stop my normal extracurriculars. Then COVID-19 hit. The research institute I work observed the anthropause, much of the work going on, including my project, ground to a halt. I began to consider how I could turn the anthropause to my advantage. How could I use this time to further my knowledge, build a skillset, or advance my career? Computer Science! Through exposure to computer science I could do all three.</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="bio"> I began by taking a course in R through the an online univeristy but quickly found I needed more rigor and more name recognition. I looked at The Univeristy Of Washington's programs and sure enough they had a coding bootcamp. It is through that bootcamp that I have compiled this portfolio. My experience throughout this 6 month intensive bootcamp has given me a substantive understanding of some frameworks around computer science. It is a foundation that I will continue to build upon throughout my carrer.
